## Welcome to Rangeet Pan's homepage
<span style="font-size:1.35em;">
I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University. I am also working as a Research Assistant at the <a href="http://design.cs.iastate.edu/"> Laboratory of Software Design</a>. My supervisor is <a href="http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~hridesh/">Dr. Hridesh Rajan</a>. I have worked as a research intern at Microsoft Research in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/saint-group/"> Software Analysis and Intelligence (SAINTes) team </a> with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nachin/">Dr. Nachi Nagappan</a>, <a href="http://vuminhle.com/">Dr. Vu Le</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/sumitg/">Dr. Sumit Gulwani</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/shuvendu/">Dr. Shuvendu Lahiri</a>. My area of expertise is Deep Neural Network, Modularity, and Program Analysis.</span>
